This dashboard provides information about damages awarded to tenants in a public housing lawsuit. The housing authority had not updated utility allowances as required by law and were sued in a class action.

This application was built using Python Streamlit for a basic presentation of the results.

Data was extracted from a government database into a large excel dataset.  The dataset was
wrangled and consolidated using Python Pandas to create summary data tables to be used in this web
application.

I was engaged as a financial expert for the defense on two separate class actions in two different cities.  The data we collected during the class action was also used by management to better understand electricity usage and costs. Identification codes, locations and actual damages have been cleaned and changed for illustration purposes.
