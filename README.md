This dashboard provides information about damages awarded to tenants in a public housing lawsuit. The housing
authority had not updated utility allowances as required by law and were sued in a class action.

This application was built using Python Streamlit for a basic presentation of the results.

Data was extracted from a government database into a large excel dataset.  The dataset was
wrangled and consolidated using Python Pandas to create summary data tables to be used in this web
application.
